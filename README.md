Have you ever played these "Choose your own adventure" game-books? Well if not, you've missed some good pre-computer gaming fun.

These gamebooks allow the player - reader to experience the book by making choices along the way which can completely change the way the main character's - yours - story develops. Each page has a number and instead of reading page by page you turn to a specific number based on your choice.

### Choose your own adventure ###

* The name of the story is Secret of the pyramids
